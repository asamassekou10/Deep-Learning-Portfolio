#  Alhassane Samassekou – Deep Learning Applications Portfolio  
**Course:** ITAI 2376 – Deep Learning Applications

##  Overview  
This portfolio showcases my work in ITAI 2376, a project- and lab-driven course focused on modern deep learning concepts and tools. It includes capstone research, architecture design, practical labs, and critical comparisons of industry frameworks like Hugging Face and OpenAI.

## Learning Objectives  
- Apply CNNs, RNNs, and transformers to real-world tasks  
- Build and fine-tune models using PyTorch and Hugging Face  
- Evaluate architectures like U-Net and BERT in diffusion and NLP tasks  
- Integrate Reinforcement Learning ideas into practical systems

## Key Projects  
- **AI Research Assistant (Capstone):**  
  Developed a self-contained research agent using SerpAPI, TF-IDF summarization, and Gradio. It performs information retrieval, citation formatting, and PDF export—all without large language model APIs.

- **Diffusion Model with U-Net:**  
  Designed a class-conditional generative model using a 3-level U-Net. Incorporated timestep embeddings, class conditioning, and evaluated results with CLIP scores.

- **Transformer Comparison Study:**  
  Conducted a comparative analysis of Hugging Face Transformers vs OpenAI GPT-4 API. Explored trade-offs in control, customization, and accessibility.

## Labs Summary  
- **PyTorch Foundations:**  
  Mastered tensors, GPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, and training logic.

- **CNN & Image Classification:**  
  Built convolutional models for image recognition. Learned to balance kernel size, pooling, and hyperparameters.

- **Text Processing & RNNs:**  
  Preprocessed text, vectorized with BoW and GloVe, then trained RNNs for sentiment analysis.

- **BERT Finetuning:**  
  Used DistilBERT to classify Amazon reviews. Adjusted batch sizes, tokenization, and epochs to improve performance.

- **Azure AI Foundry (Generative AI):**  
  Deployed GPT-4 in Azure, explored prompt engineering, resource provisioning, and responsible deployment practices.

## Real-World Applications  
- **Academic Research:**  
  Automated information extraction and citation using my Research Agent.

- **Healthcare:**  
  CNN and image denoising techniques for diagnostic enhancement.

- **E-commerce & Social Media:**  
  Sentiment classifiers and RNNs to analyze reviews and trends.

- **Creative AI:**  
  Exploring generative design and guided image synthesis through diffusion models.

## Tools & Technologies  
- PyTorch  
- Transformers (Hugging Face, OpenAI GPT-4 API)  
- SerpAPI, Gradio, FPDF  
- CLIP, U-Net, BERT, RNN  
- Azure AI Foundry  
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
